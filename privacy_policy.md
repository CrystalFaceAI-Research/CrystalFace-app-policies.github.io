## 1. Information We Collect

### a) User Content

- When creating an identity, we keep **less than 1 KB of numerical feature representations** for processing and **do not store the face image itself**.

### b) Login Data
- If you sign in with Firebase, we may collect your email address.

### c) Analytics & Advertising Data
We use third-party services to improve the app and serve ads:

| Service | Data Collected | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| Firebase Analytics | Device info, usage patterns | App performance and analytics |
| Google Analytics | Device info, app usage | Analytics and performance tracking |
| AdMob | Device identifiers, IP address, app usage | Personalized and non-personalized advertising |
| Meta (Facebook Audience Network) | Device identifiers, app usage, IP | Personalized and non-personalized advertising |
| AppLovin | Device identifiers, IP, app usage | Personalized and non-personalized advertising |

**Personalized Ads:** Some ad networks may show ads based on your activity.  
**Opt-out:** You can limit ad personalization via your device settings (Google/Apple ad settings).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information only to:
- Apply face-swapping and face-enhancement effects to uploaded media.
- Provide app functionality and improve user experience.
- Support analytics and advertising through trusted third-party tools.

We **do not** sell, trade, or share your photos or videos for other purposes.

## 3. Data Storage & Retention

- Uploaded photos and videos are stored securely for **up to 24 hours** and then permanently deleted.
- Subscription information, processing logs (like counts of face swaps), and identity feature data (1 KB per identity) are stored as needed.
- No one, including us, can access your uploaded photos or videos.
- Since most user data is automatically deleted, general deletion requests for photos/videos are **not applicable**.

## 4. Account Deletion

Since CrystalFace does not permanently store user profiles or uploaded media, most data is automatically deleted within 24 hours.  

If you wish to delete your **subscription log data, processing count logs, or created identities**, you can contact us at:
